# Data Wrangling, Analyses and Visualization on Weratedogs tweets

## Introduction
The dataset i have wrangled and analysed is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for me to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.
